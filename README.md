## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack developer graduated from Faculdade Santa Marcelina, with experience in TypeScript, PHP and relational databases, such as MySQL and SQL Server. I also work with integrations between systems, especially with TOTVS RM, and consumption and implementations of APIs.

I'm also a supporter of the Clean Code and Clean Architecture philosophy. A well-defined structure and clear, well-written code are essential for the maintenance and scalability of any project.

I value continuous learning and sharing experiences, as I understand that these characteristics are important in an area that is constantly evolving, in addition to benefiting the technology community as a whole.
